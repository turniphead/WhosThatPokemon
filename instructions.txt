Who's That Pokemon?!

Remember when you'd be watching pokemon, and right before the commercials you were asked to guess the identity of a silhouetted Pokemon? Well now you can do it to your hearts content!

In this game, the object is to correctly type the name of the pokemon on the screen, as fast as you can! You get more points for completing it quickly.

Do you have what it takes to guess them all?
